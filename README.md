# Pickup Analysis

R Package that holds my codes and analysis of Uber's Pickup data in the city of Bengaluru for the first quarter of 2020.

## Description

The goal of this project is to learn ggplot2 visualisation for a spatial dataset and to deliver basic analytics for the same using R language. The motivation for working with this project is to get a holistic understanding of the usage of R language in analytics domain and also to develop a familiarity with ggplot2 visualisations. Analysing Uberâ€™s pickup data for Bengaluru City using plots and maps provide a better understanding of the large dataset, compared to viewing data in the dataframe.
